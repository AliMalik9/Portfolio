## Minimalism

Minimalist design emphasizes simplicity with lots of white space, a limited color palette, and straightforward typography. It's perfect for projects that want to convey clarity, such as SaaS platforms, portfolio websites, or online stores.

## Material Design

Material Design uses shadows, layers, and movement to create a sense of depth, giving the user the impression that elements are tangible. It's ideal for interactive content like dashboards, SaaS platforms, and news apps.
